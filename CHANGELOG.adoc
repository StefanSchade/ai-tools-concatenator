* Exclude files based on glob patterns such as `*.jpg` or `*lock.json`.
* Exclude directories specified in the `.gitignore` - *The following limitations apply:*
** Only the `.gitignore` on the top level of the repo is considered
** Only full directories to be excluded are considered
** Pattern matches are not considered at this point and have to be passed as a parameter separately
* Certain paths are always excluded
** any path containing `node_modules`
** `target`
** `.git`

* Optional line numbering for each line in the concatenated output to help the KI to associate compilation errors with the correct location in the source.
