== AI Tool: Concateneator

This tool is designed to concatenate text files from a specified directory structure into a single output file. It allows for the exclusion of files based on glob patterns and optionally numbers each line in the resulting output.

After applying this on a project repo, the output can then be shared with a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide context to your interaction.

== Features

* Concatenate all text files in a directory and subdirectories.
* Exclude files based on glob patterns such as `*.jpg` or `*lock.json`.
* Exclude directories specified in the `.gitignore` - *The following limitations apply:*
** Only the `.gitignore` on the top level of the repo is considered
** Only full directories to be excluded are considered
** Pattern matches are not considered at this point and have to be passed as a parameter separately
* Certain paths are always excluded
    ** any path containing `node_modules`
    ** `target`
    ** `.git`
    ** `.idea`
* Optional line numbering for each line in the concatenated output to help the KI to associate compilation errors with the correct location in the source.

== Prerequisites

If you want to compile the file yourself, you have to setup a Rust environment:

- Rust Programming Language: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Cargo (Rust's Package Manager, included with Rust installation)

then you can perform the compilation with the usual commands, e.g. `cargo build --release`

== Usage

Use the executable like follows: `concatenator.exe <source_dir> <output_file> [exclude_patterns...] [--line-numbers]`

* `<source_dir>`: The directory from which files will be read.
* `<output_file>`: The file to which concatenated output will be written.
* `[exclude_patterns...]`: Optional. Glob patterns to exclude files from being processed.
* `--line-numbers`: Optional. Prepend each line with its line number.

=== Examples

To concatenate all files in the logs directory into a single `output.txt`, excluding any .jpg and .tmp files:

[bash]
----------
concatenator.exe logs output.txt *.jpg *.tmp
----------

To concatenate all files in a repo into a single `sources.txt`, excluding pictures and the `package-lock.json` while including line numbers:

[bash]
----------
concatenator.exe ./ source.txt *.JPG *.jpg *lock.json --line-numbers
----------

=== Distributing Binaries
Compiled binaries can be found on the Releases page, facilitating easier access for users without a Rust setup.

=== Download Executable

For users who do not want to compile the project themselves, I will publish a windows executable on the https://github.com/StefanSchade/ai-tools-concatenator/releases[Releases page]

Executables for MacOS and Linux might follow - at the moment, I do not have a setup on these environments though.
